I am writing this here or I will forget about it.

## current

This section is for things I need to work on

1. oopa
2. ~~surface blitting (currently I directly render to window surface pixel buffer)~~
3. Draw Rects
4. hot reload.
5. weird winmain/main warning I get on windows when compiling
6. key handling. I wrote more details in the todo there

## planned features

This section is for big picture things I plan to add eventually

### general

**meta programmer**
I want to be able to use annotations like @compile_time. So I need to make a parser to make sense
of annotations. I tried it before but it was shit because it started out as something else that
I later decided to make into a meta programmer. I want this mainly for reflection.
