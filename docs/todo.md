## planned features

This section is for big picture things I plan to add eventually

### general

**meta programmer**
I want to be able to use annotations like @compile_time. So I need to make a parser to make sense
of annotations. I tried it before but it was shit because it started out as something else that
I later decided to make into a meta programmer. I want this mainly for reflection.
