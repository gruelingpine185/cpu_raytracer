I will write game shit here or I will forget

"Remember, you can press S to save incase you want to come back later and complete this set up"
(encourages save scumming but a lot of my puzzles will be unforgiving and will
requre restart and I don't want to add a time travelling mechanic. so i have no problem.
Perhaps I can just have checkpoints? And an option to die? No. Dying should never be an option,
that is inhumane (I am humane))

Currently, I want to add two things ->

1. snakeself collision
2. If he does, he cuts off those bits. This will be used in a puzzle for times when 
   you need to be a specific size.
3. The puzzle in question is one where the tv asks to have all his pixels returned and promises to
    give you a special pixel so you don't have to constantly move. Now, in the third stage of the
    snake phase, you grow smaller. But its not enough to completely die. So you need to eat yourself
    and then die. The number of pixels that spawn in this stage will be always be less than your size
    and I hope the player discovers that eating himself makes him smaller.
