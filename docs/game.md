3. The puzzle in question is one where the tv asks to have all his pixels returned and promises to  give you a special pixel so you don't have to constantly move. Now, in the third stage of the snake phase, you grow smaller. But its not enough to completely die. So you need to eat yourself and then die. The number of pixels that spawn in this stage will be always be less than your size and I hope the player discovers that eating himself makes him smaller.
