I don't wan't some ramblings inside code or my todo. So I will periodically move them here


## Saving

"Remember, you can press S to save incase you want to come back later and complete this set up"
(encourages save scumming but a lot of my puzzles will be unforgiving and will
requre restart and I don't want to add a time travelling mechanic. so i have no problem.
Perhaps I can just have checkpoints? And an option to die? No. Dying should never be an option,
that is inhumane (I am humane))
