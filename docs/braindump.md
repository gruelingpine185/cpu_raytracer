<!--
I don't wan't some ramblings inside code or my todo. So I will periodically move them here

## Jam ideas

// this goes on till everything is black because pixels keep generating.
        // And then you explore the puzzle
        // But you will grow small and die if you don't eat pixels so you must eat pixels
        // I will communicate with flashing red
        // No No No
        // you eat pixels. you get bigger in size. then they disappear. then you go back to horizontal
        // way and then it says, "loading faster"
        // more pixels appear
        // "loading very fast"
        // more pixels
        // can't eat anymore
        // i'm dying
        // can't cross self perhaps either?
        // I am tired. I have been up for a long time. I feel like shit. I've been barely
        // getting by. I find this interesting enough to pursue so perhaps I will continue
        // this in the future assuming I don't do the big no no


## Saving

"Remember, you can press S to save incase you want to come back later and complete this set up"
(encourages save scumming but a lot of my puzzles will be unforgiving and will
requre restart and I don't want to add a time travelling mechanic. so i have no problem.
Perhaps I can just have checkpoints? And an option to die? No. Dying should never be an option,
that is inhumane (I am humane))
